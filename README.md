# Tic-Tac-Toe--JAVA
This program is a popular game Tic-tac-toe, I created using basic java programming. It is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns defining distances in a 3 x 3 grid 
(this symbol  "_"  means the case is empty). The winner is the player who has succeeded in placing three of his markers in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row.
